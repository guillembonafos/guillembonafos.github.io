abstract: Statistical learning refers to our sensitivity to the distributional properties
  of our environment. Humans have been shown to readily detect the dependency relationship
  of events that occur adjacently in a stream of stimuli but processing non-adjacent
  dependencies (NADs) appears more challenging. In the present study, we tested the
  ability of human participants to detect NADs in a new Hebb-naming task that has
  been proposed recently to study regularity detection in a noisy environment. In
  three experiments, we found that most participants did not manage to extract NADs.
  These results suggest that the ability to learn NADs in noise is the exception rather
  than the rule. They provide new information about the limits of statistical learning
  mechanisms.
