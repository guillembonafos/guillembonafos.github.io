abstract: The data collection process consisted of continuously recording an enclosure
  of Guinea baboons for one month. They live in semi-liberty at the CNRS primatology
  centre in Rousset. A microphone was placed nearby to record the sounds produced
  by the group without the presence of a human. A neural network was used on these
  large and noisy audio recordings, following the method of Bonafos et al. (2023).
  The neural network automatically detected segments in the data stream when the baboons
  produced vocalisations. The dataset consists of one second to several minute wav
  files of automatically detected segments of vocalisations produced in semi-natural
  environments. The dataset thus provides a new set of baboon vocalisations produced
  at all times of the day, without the presence of a recording human. It can be used
  to learn more about the vocal productions of non-human primates, their distribution
  over the day, their frequency, and their heterogeneity. In addition to the analysis
  of animal communication, the dataset can also be used as a learning base for sound
  recognition models.
