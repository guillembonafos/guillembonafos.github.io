abstract: Regularity detection, or statistical learning, is regarded as a fundamental
  component of our cognitive system. To test the ability of human participants to
  detect regularity in a more ecological situation (i.e., mixed with random information),
  we used a simple letter-naming paradigm in which participants were instructed to
  name single letters presented one at a time on a computer screen. The regularity
  consisted of a triplet of letters that were systematically presented in that order.
  Participants were not told about the presence of this regularity. A variable number
  of random letters were presented between two repetitions of the regular triplet,
  making this paradigm similar to a Hebb repetition task. Hence, in this Hebb-naming
  task, we predicted that if any learning of the triplet occurred, naming times for
  the predictable letters in the triplet would decrease as the number of triplet repetitions
  increased. Surprisingly, across four experiments, detection of the regularity only
  occurred under very specific experimental conditions and was far from a trivial
  task. Our study provides new evidence regarding the limits of statistical learning
  and the critical role of contextual information in the detection (or not) of repeated
  patterns.
